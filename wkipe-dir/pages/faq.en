<p><b>What is a URL shortener?</b><br/>
URL shorteners are important tools for the social networking community and internet community at large. When communication is plain-text but with URL support rather than full HTML (as is the case with Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.), it isn't clear where the URL will take you. Many now allow you to enter your own alias for the link. But these aliases are permanent, and so someone may have taken the one you want. </p>

<p>If you want to link specifically to Wikipedia, and you want it to be completely clear where the user is going, <a href="main" dest="local">wki.pe</a> is the answer. Also, you don't have to generate shortened URLs for the articles; they are created automatically. For example, if you wanted to link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example</a>, the shortened URL for this <a href="http://wki.pe/Example">wki.pe/Example</a>. Spaces are represented as underscores, just as they are on Wikipedia's URLs, so <a href="http://wki.pe/Bertrand_Russell">wki.pe/Bertrand_Russell</a> links to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell</a>. This means that you can use the link in place of the word in your message as well, saving even more space:</p>

<p><blockquote><i>tomorrow I have to write report on <a href="http://wki.pe/bertrand_russell">wki.pe/bertrand_russell</a> but I haven't started yet. <a href="http://twitter.com/wikipedia">@wikipedia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FTW&src=hash">#FTW</a></i></blockquote></p>

<p>Capitalization doesn't matter. If you follow a link to a  Wikipedia article that doesn't exist, wki.pe checks ahead of you and replaces it with a search instead. For example, <a href="http://wki.pe/does_not_exist">wki.pe/does_not_exist</a></p>
<!-- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/does_not_exist "The page "Does not exist" does not exist." -->

<p><b>What if you have a really long article name?</b><br/>
We have a fix for that, too. In the same way that other URLs let you use your own alias for pages, too. For example, if you want to link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder</a>, you can go <a href="main" dest="local">here</a>, enter the name of the article ("List of people...") and what you want to use for your alias (for example, "suspected BPD candidates") and wki.pe will generate a custom link for you (<a href="http://a.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates">a.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates</a>). The character(s) before wki.pe are generated by us. It makes your link a couple characters longer, but it allows multiple people to use the same alias to point to different articles (for example, <a href="http://b.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates">b.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates</a> points to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Police_Department">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Police_Department</a> and <a href="http://c.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates">c.wki.pe/suspected_BPD_candidates</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Punarnirman_Dal#Elections_Contested">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Punarnirman_Dal#Elections_Contested</a> instead).</p>

<p>You can still use the general scheme to link long articles, too: <a href="http://wki.pe/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder">wki.pe/List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder</a></p>

<p><b>What about users who speak different languages?</b><br/>
We planned for that, too. By default, wki.pe looks up the locale of the visitor and, if possible, returns the version of the article in the local language for that area. You can disable this by generating it on the main page. You can generate either type of shortened URL there (direct or aliased).</p>

<p><b>I have other questions that aren't answered here.</b><br/>
If you <a href="contact" dest="local">contact me</a>, I will try and help you.
